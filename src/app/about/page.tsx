            I&apos;m constantly working to improve myself and learn new things, so expect
            all sorts of projects and project types! I&apos;ve been learning new recipes
            to cook recently, so I was thinking about documenting those projects as
            well. We&apos;ll see. Anyway, I hope you enjoy your time here! Bathrooms are
            in the back...
