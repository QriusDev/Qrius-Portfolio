                Okay, the music has been turned on and I&apos;ve wrapped up some auxilliary work. Now it&apos;s time to write the the first blog post of the site! 
                <br/><br/>
                <b>Welcome to my portfolio website!</b> 
                <br/><br/>
                First off, the site title is a play on my first name Daquaris, pronounced Dah-quah-ris, but is most of the time pronounced as Dah-que-rius. As a kid, I hated how often it was mispronounced, so I insisted on the use of the name my family uses to refer to me, Alex (which is just a shortened version of my middle name). So, taking &apos;rius&apos; and applying the letter that my mother was obsessed with adding to my brother&apos;s and my name: Q. This concatination also just so happens to sound like the best word to describe me: Curious. Thus, <b>Qrius Alex</b>.
                <br/><br/>
                So, who am I and why should you care? Uhhh, I&apos;m nobody and you probably shouldn&apos;t. But if you do care, I go by the name Alex, and I would describe myself as someone in perpetual search for progress. Getting better than I was yesterday is a goal that I strive for every day and recently I&apos;ve been hitting this goal nonstop. <i>It should be noted that there are negative ways to live in this way, but I think I&apos;ve figured out my healthy groove!</i> Its just something that I want and it makes me happy that I can search for it. It excites me that perfection is impossible, because it means that I&apos;ll never be bored.
                <br/><br/>
                These skills do not stop at my development/engineering skills! My social skills, my personal skills, my knowledge of everything under the sun, etc. Its everything. Knowing that I might be mistaken on something, drives me to learn more about it and challenge my own position by speaking with someone trusted. When I was a kid I heard the sentiment <q>You just want to be right!</q> a lot. And I was never equipped to explain why it was such a mischaracterization of my position in the discussion. Its not that I want to be right, I just want to always <i>come to an understanding</i>. In fact, when I&apos;m speaking with someone who realizes that, they tend to note that they haven&apos;t heard my opinion the entire conversation, since the investigation of my mistake doesn&apos;t involve my opinoin until muuuuuch later, if needed. When I&apos;m speaking with someone who I trust to have a responsible back and forth with, my only objective is to try to get understanding. I don&apos;t always think that I&apos;m just right. Instead, I&apos;m trying to undertsand what misunderstanding is present or if there is a <b>fundamental disagreement</b>. I might dive deeper into this topic in a later post, since the idea of a fundamental disagreement is so important to perspective on discussion, but this is just an example of what growth means to me. Becoming better means confronting my mistakes and humbling myself by admitting to someone who may have been affected by my mistake (usually just admitting that I was mistaken in a conversation, or afterward if I wasn&apos;t able to.) It not easy, but it gets easier and it improves one&apos;s humility tenfold.

                I went on a bit of a tangent, but lets get back to the main point. I love creating, learning, and sharing. This website will be my public representation of those loves. I hope you enjoy your stay, and way more updates and blog posts to come!

            <q>My goal is to continue to be the best I can be as well as expand on what I can <i>be</i>.</q> It sounds hopeful but naive; there is no way to measure <i>what I can be</i> or if I am applying the <i>most I can</i>, so it seems arbitrary...thus empty! Meaningless! And as true as this is, I challenge your interpretation of that statement. I present to you the nuance of that statement, which is that, I can <i>feel</i> if I am applying my everything. I can have a good idea of what I <i>can be</i>. Now, this is important! Write this down! My goal quote is also a statement of trust in my <i>self understanding</i>. My self understanding is <b>not</b> something that I have had trust in for most of my life. Instead, it is something that I have cultivated through years of confronting my own inadequecies and mistakes with a critical but realistic lense. And it would not be possible without the people who I choose to surround myself with.
            <br/><br/>
            My friends tend to be those that are very open to giving their own opinions even to my own emotional effect. Now, you are probably rolling your eyes since it is really easy to say that but again, I challenge your interpretation. Though it might take its own dedicated blog post, through my own effort in being realistic and critical of myself while also committing to the acceptance of criticism on my side with a &quot;Thank you&quot; whenever its given to me. I try to never respond to criticisms with malice or spite. Now, I am only human and emotions may get the better of me at times but as soon as I feel any clarity, I make it my mission to express my gratitude for any criticisms. This is obviously very nuanced but the main point is that it takes more than <i>me</i> to find trust in my own world view. And, it takes constant humility and dedication to open oneself up to criticism and extract growth from these <i>sometimes hurtful nuggets of growth</i>.
            <br/><br/>
            Something that I have concluded recently is that my perpetual growth is made much easier when other perspectives are added in the mix. I am a flawed human being, as we all are. But together, we have so much knowledge, we have so many experiences, and we have so many skills. Why wouldn&apos;t including others help? My friends are diverse in every way that you can think of. With such a diverse group of friends that are open to being blunt, alongside my dedication to growth and fairly challenging my own beliefs, I can stand confident that I am very aware of the biases I can apply to my own beliefs that could inhibit me from finding truth.
            <br/><br/>
            And with this confidence in knowledge of my own biases, along with my understanding of self, with the perspectives of others, I can be confident that my <i>Self Understanding</i> is, at least, close to accurate and from there, I can measure success within my goal! Did you forget the point? Because, I kind of did. Anyway, in persuit of getting the confidence to measure my self understanding, it also requires me to apply my goal. It is recursive...in a way. Which is cool. 
            <br/><br/>
            So, through the many future updates of this site, I hope to present my journey of success with this goal. Hopefully, others can find value in this because I really think its effective for someone with a desire to continue to grow. I also have many examples of things to do to to make it easier to do. This lifestyle is not a walk in the park. Sometimes I have to come to terms with things I do not want to think about, but always remember &quot;You grow the most after the hard times&quot;.
